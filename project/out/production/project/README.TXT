This project is my lazily-done Chess-engine, which should beat your asses :3

Notes for my demented self:
- The figures are represented by bytes in increasing order of value: P, N, B, R, Q, K.
Whereas 0 represents an empty field.
- The bottom left corner is the coordinate origin, while the upper right corner is (7, 7).
- White is located at the bottom.
